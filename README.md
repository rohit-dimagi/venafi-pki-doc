## Venafi Cloud Demo With HashiCorp Vault

### Venafi Cloud Account Setup

#### Step 1: Set Up a Trial Account
1. Use your HashiCorp email to create a trial account at [Venafi Cloud](https://venafi.com/try-venafi/tls-protect/).
2. After creating and verifying the account, log in to Venafi Cloud.

#### Step 2: Create a Certificate Authority (CA)
1. Navigate to **Integrations** -> **Certificate Authorities**.

#### Step 4: Create an Application
Now we will Create an application which will have the configuration to utilize the above created template to Issue the certificates. Itâ€™s like a Container for all the certificates being issued using this template. This application will also have a separate apikey which will be used for integration with Hashicorp vault PKI engine.

1. Navigate to **Applications** -> **New**.
2. Select the issuing template and assign an account owner.
